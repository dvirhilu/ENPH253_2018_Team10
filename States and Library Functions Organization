line 28 typo

have one main code (Robot.ino)
separate libraries for functions

instead of booleans, use enums (can have more than 2 states)
- ex. claw : picked up stuffy, not activated, detected, etc

replace all delays with the non blocking poll() methods


LIBRARIES:
- StuffyRescue
	States (StuffyState)
	- search (arms raised, claws open) & detecting for stuffies
	- detected (stop robot and move arms down towards stuffy)
	- captured (stuffy inside the claws)
	- fuckedUp (stuffy inside the bin)
	Functions
	- poll() : check if stuffy detected
	- setup() : lower arm & open claws for capture
	- pickup() : picks up stuffy & puts into the bin. checks if limit switch has been pressed
**need code for failure handling & considering noise
- bin lifting
	States (BinState)
	- search (bin down, searching for archway on the top)
	- detected (archway detected, start rasing bin)
	- lower (lower the bin) - not sure what the cue will be to start this
	- end (crossed suspension bridge, so final lift)
	Functions
	- poll() : check if zipline above is detected
	- raise() : raise lift
	- lower() : lower lift
- follow tape
	States
	- ??????
	Functions
	- ??????
- bridge
	States (BridgeState)
	- stand by (wait until edge detected)
	- edge detected
	- align (use gyroscope to align perpendicular to the edge)
	- 1st bridge
	- 2nd bridge
	Functions
	- state : 1st bridge or second bridge
- frequency detection
	States (FreqState)
	- off (before 1st bridge lay down or after the archway)
	- 1kHz
	- 10kHz before stuffy
	- 10kHz after stuffy
	Functions
	- poll() : check for frequency signals
